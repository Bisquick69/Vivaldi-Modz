Some of these may work or may in fact **not** \* _gasp_ \* as a result of personal setup or whathaveyou OR as a result of me not making sure it will work but for my own personal setup. If something is off feel free to scream into the void or directly at me, but preferably into said void.

When you scream into the abyss, the abyss will not give many shits and may in fact scream back at you (though it's just your own screams, but who's counting really)

Ok baaaaaaaaai
